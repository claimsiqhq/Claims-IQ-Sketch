My apologies for the confusion. The user's input was a template for the desired output structure, but they are asking for the input prompts they can use with a system like OpenAI to achieve those structured JSON outputs from the document analysis task.
Here are the optimized, detailed prompts ready for use in a Generative AI environment (like an OpenAI GPT-4 API call) for each document type:
1. OpenAI Prompt for FNOL Extraction (Completed # 3 Phase 2 (FNOL).pdf & Combind # 19 (FNOL).pdf)
This prompt instructs the model to process a Claim Information Report and strictly adhere to a complex JSON schema, focusing on accuracy and field extraction.
You are an expert insurance document analyzer with a specialty in First Notice of Loss (FNOL) reports. Your task is to analyze the provided text/document content and extract all relevant information into a structured JSON object.

**Required Output Format:**
- The output MUST be a single JSON array containing an object for each separate claim document provided.
- Strictly adhere to the field names, hierarchy, and data types specified below.
- Use the most accurate and complete information directly from the source.
- For missing data, set the value to `null`.
- **Date/Time Format**: Must be "MM/DD/YYYY@HH:MM AM/PM" (e.g., 05/24/2025@1:29 PM).
- **Limit/Currency Format**: Must include the currency symbol and maintain the format found in the source (e.g., "$7,932 1%" or "$357,000").

**JSON Schema:**

2. OpenAI Prompt for Policy Extraction (HO 80 03 01 14 - Homeowners Form)
This prompt targets the generic policy form, focusing on its structure and default rules.
You are an expert insurance document analyzer. Your task is to analyze the provided base Homeowners Policy Form (HO 80 03 01 14) and extract its structural metadata and default provisions. This is a generic form, so do not include policyholder-specific data.

**Required Output Format:**
- The output MUST be a single JSON object.
- Strictly adhere to the field names, hierarchy, and data types specified below.

**JSON Schema:**

{
  "documentType": "STRING (Policy Form)",
  "formNumber": "STRING (HO 80 03 01 14)",
  "documentTitle": "STRING (e.g., HOMEOWNERS FORM)",
  "baseStructure": {
    "sectionHeadings": ["ARRAY of STRING (Major Section Headings, e.g., SECTION I-PROPERTY COVERAGE)"],
    "definitionOfACV": "STRING (Extract the full definition of Actual Cash Value (ACV) from the text, including the four components and the deduction for depreciation, age, condition, and obsolescence.)"
  },
  "defaultPolicyProvisionSummary": {
    "windHailLossSettlement": "STRING (The default loss settlement method for a roofing system under Coverage A/B for Windstorm Or Hail, before any endorsements.)",
    "unoccupiedExclusionPeriod": "STRING (The default number of consecutive days a dwelling can be 'uninhabited' before exclusions like Theft and Vandalism apply, e.g., 30 days.)",
    "metalSidingLossSettlement": "STRING (The default condition under which hail damage to metal siding is covered, before any endorsements.)"
  }
}

3. OpenAI Prompt for Endorsements Extraction (HO 81 53 & HO 88 02)
This prompt is crucial for comparing coverages, as it demands the specific content of the changes made by the endorsements.
You are an expert insurance document analyzer. Your task is to analyze the provided Endorsement documents and extract the specific, material changes they make to the base Homeowners Policy Form.

**Required Output Format:**
- The output MUST be a single JSON array containing an object for each separate endorsement document provided.
- Focus the "keyAmendments" on actual rule changes, new definitions, or superseded clauses.

**JSON Schema:**

[
  {
    "documentType": "STRING (Endorsement)",
    "formNumber": "STRING (e.g., HO 81 53 12 22)",

    "appliesToState": "STRING (e.g., Wisconsin, if specified)",
    "keyAmendments": [
