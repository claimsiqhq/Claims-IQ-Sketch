Build a modern, mobile-first web application for property insurance claims estimation. This is a unified platform where field adjusters capture property data and generate estimates in a single workflow.

## Tech Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- React Router for navigation
- Lucide React for icons
- Recharts for any data visualization

## Application Structure

### 1. Authentication & Home
- Simple login screen (mock auth for PoC)
- Home dashboard showing:
  - Active claims list (cards with property address, claim type, status, last updated)
  - Quick stats: Claims in progress, Completed today, Pending review
  - "New Claim" prominent button

### 2. New Claim / Claim Detail View
When creating or viewing a claim, show a tabbed interface:

**Tab: Property Info**

- Roof type
- Number of stories
- Claim type (Water, Fire, Wind/Hail, Impact, Other)
- Date of loss
- Carrier dropdown
- Policy number

**Tab: Sketch / Capture**
This is the core differentiator - a visual property model builder:

Left Panel (60% width):
- Interactive floor plan canvas
- Tools toolbar at top:
  - Select tool
  - Room tool (click to place rooms, drag to resize)
  - Wall tool (draw walls)
  - Door/Window tool
  - Measurement tool
- Room shapes snap to grid
- Rooms display: name, dimensions, square footage
- Click a room to select it and see/edit details in right panel

Right Panel (40% width):
- When no room selected: Property summary, story selector (Floor 1, Floor 2, Basement, etc.)

- Save creates a damage zone attached to that room

**Tab: Scope**
Shows all damage zones across the property with recommended line items:

- Expandable sections by room
- Each damage zone shows:
  - Damage type badge
  - Affected area
  - Thumbnail of photos
  - List of auto-suggested line items with checkboxes
  - Each line item shows: Code, Description, Quantity, Unit, Unit Price, Total
  - "Add Line Item" button opens searchable line item picker
  - Line items can be edited (quantity, notes)

- Bottom summary bar:
  - Subtotal
  - O&P percentage (editable)
  - Tax (based on region)
  - Grand Total
  - "Generate Estimate" button

**Tab: Estimate**
The generated estimate document view:

Gallery view of all photos attached to claim:
- Grid of thumbnails
- Filter by room or damage zone
- Click to expand with metadata (room, damage zone, timestamp, notes)
- Bulk upload capability

### 3. Line Item Search Modal
When adding line items, show a searchable modal:
- Search input at top
- Category filter pills (Water Mitigation, Drywall, Flooring, Painting, etc.)
- Results list showing:
  - Code
  - Description
  - Unit
  - Base price
  - Click to add with quantity input

### 4. Settings
- User profile
- Default O&P percentages

## Visual Design
- Clean, professional aesthetic suitable for insurance industry
- Primary color: Deep blue (#1e3a5f)
- Accent color: Teal (#0d9488)
- Success: Green (#22c55e)
- Warning: Amber (#f59e0b)
- Error: Red (#ef4444)
- Light gray backgrounds for panels
- White cards with subtle shadows
- Consistent 8px spacing grid
- Mobile-responsive (hamburger menu on mobile, tabs become bottom nav)

## Interactive Floor Plan Canvas
For the sketch tool, create a simplified but functional floor plan editor:
- SVG or Canvas-based
- Grid background (1ft squares)
- Rooms are rectangles with:
  - Drag to move
  - Corner handles to resize
  - Double-click to edit name
  - Color-coded by room type
  - Dimensions displayed on edges
  - Area displayed in center
- Damage zones shown as red/orange overlays on affected rooms
- Zoom and pan controls
- Undo/redo

## State Management
Use Zustand stores for:
- Current claim data
- Room/sketch data
- Line items catalog
- Pricing data
- User preferences

## Mock Data
Include realistic mock data:
- 3-4 sample claims in various states
- 50+ line items across categories (Water Mitigation, Drywall, Flooring, Painting, Roofing, etc.)
- Sample room configurations
- Sample damage scenarios

## API Structure (for backend integration)
Prepare fetch calls (can be mocked initially) for:
- GET /api/claims - list claims
- GET /api/claims/:id - claim detail
- POST /api/claims - create claim
- PUT /api/claims/:id - update claim
- GET /api/line-items - search line items
- GET /api/line-items/categories - get categories
- POST /api/estimates/:claimId/generate - generate estimate
- GET /api/pricing/region/:zipCode - get regional pricing

Build this as a fully functional prototype that demonstrates the unified field capture and estimation workflow. Focus on the sketch/capture tab as the hero feature - this is what differentiates the product.
